# School of Fish - Intro to AngularJS (Exercise #2)

This is a base project structure that continues from exercise #1 and #2

* Run "npm install" before you get started. 
* Run "gulp" to build the initial JS and SCSS build, then immediately start a "watch" for any changes in JS or styles

## The Task:

Building on exercise #1, make the following addition:
* Utilize the [Google Static Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/intro) to add a static map on the page based on city search
* Create a common module/directive and use dependency injection
* Use API key: AIzaSyCyjJil5SwedV1s5SpPIpyVJ2fxG7lWROE, or generate your own

Based on the last 2 exercises, create unit tests that will:
* Create a mock for the weather API
* Check the openweathermap API is called on submit
* Check the weather data is properly getting populated

## Bonus:
* Create unit tests for the Google Static Map directive
